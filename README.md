# ML Bot

A deep learning model that classifies text messages as spam or legitimate using TensorFlow and Keras. 
It preprocesses raw text data, converts it into numerical sequences through vectorization, and trains a neural network to identify spam with high accuracy.

Used in [TextSentinel](https://github.com/sanjitmukesh/textsentinel).
